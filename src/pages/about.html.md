## About The Mason Jar Project

Building a better bloody mary.

It's started out pretty small. My initial goal is to nail down the best bloody mary I possibly could. I set out trying all sorts of different ideas and tasting bloody marys all everywhere I went. Eventually I was not only sourcing and experiementing with the best ingredients and recipies, but actually making my own infusions, mixes and garnishes.

I needed a place to store all this stuff and GitHub seemed like a perfect choice. Wasn't too long that I began to chat about it with Chad and got him on board with a bit of an expanded scope.  We're just getting started, and hope to see this grow into a fun community project.  Feel free to get in touch if you want to help out.
